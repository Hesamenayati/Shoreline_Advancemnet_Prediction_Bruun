# Shoreline_Advancement_Prediction_Bruun
Code for integrating the Bruun rule with sediment Compatibility Index (CI) for shoreline advancement predictions under falling water levels.

## Overview
This Python code integrates the Bruun rule with a Compatibility Index (CI) to predict shoreline advancement under falling water levels. It enhances the original Bruun rule by accounting for sediment compatibility in the active zone and extends its applicability to mixed sediment profiles (sandy and sandy-gravel beaches). This tool is useful for coastal management, especially under changing water levels due to climate change.

## Instructions
The instructions for using the code are provided in the **first cell** of the Jupyter notebook (`Shoreline_Advancement_Prediction.ipynb`). This cell contains:
1. An overview of how to interact with the code.
2. Detailed user input prompts for entering sediment data, profile depth, and shoreline change.
3. A step-by-step guide for running the code, making predictions, and interpreting the results.

Please read the instructions in the first cell before proceeding with any further steps.
